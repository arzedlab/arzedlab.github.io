Hi, I'm Ravshan! I'm a cybersecurity researcher with a passion for digging deep into anything that involves assembly 😊. I love uncovering how things work at the most fundamental levels, but it is hard to do. When I'm not diving into cybersecurity, you can find me cycling, exploring new routes and staying active. 🚴‍♂️

This blog marks the beginning of my journey, and while I'll keep adding more details in the future, for now, this is a good start. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something useful here!
### Education 🎓:
