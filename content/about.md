My name is Ravshan Rikhsiev, a cybersecurity researcher at [ONESEC](https://onesec.uz) with a technical focus on low-level systems: firmware, kernel subsystems, compilers, reverse engineering, and low-level programming. My research spans vulnerability discovery, exploit development, and methods to make fixes verifiable and safe in production systems. I regularly publish technical posts, present at security workshops, and mentor students because I believe strong communities accelerate learning and responsible research. On this site, you’ll find writeups, tools, and reproducible artifacts from my projects, along with resources for hands-on learning. Off-duty from systems exploration, my passion is cycling, which is where I think, recharge, and plan new outreach initiatives. If you’re interested in collaboration, teaching, or talks, please get in touch.
